Synthetix is an innovative platform that utilises SOTA AI models to generate captivating videos. Powered by **Llama 3**, Synthetix combines bleeding edge technologies to create engaging content. It utilizes Microsoft's **SpeechT5** to convert text into natural-sounding speech and incorporates enthralling visuals sourced from a search API..for now. We plan to replace the visuals source with SD model once we find an appropriate source of compute after the prototype.

Initially we are trying to finetune Llama-3 on **TEDX talks** and **TEDEd** videos to make the videos' *prose* slightly more alike those of great teachers and presenters.

With Synthetix, users can effortlessly create high-quality videos on any subject, making it an invaluable tool for _content creators, educators, and businesses alike_. As such, this makes the domains in which this powerful application can be used numerous in nature and globally applicable.
