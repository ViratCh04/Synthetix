"Healthier men, one moustache at a time - Adam Garone",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6D4Mmr2E7hM,"  I think the beautiful Mullen put it perfectly every man deserves the opportunity to grow a little bit of luxury ladies and gentlemen more importantly Mo Bros and mo sisters for the next 70 minutes I'm going to share with you my movember journey and how through that Journey we've redefined charity we're redefining the way prostate cancer researchers are working together throughout the world and I hope through that process that I inspire you to create something significant in your life something significant that will go on and make this world a better place so the most common question I get asked I'm going to answer it now so I don't have to do it over drinks tonight uh is how did this come about how did movember start well normally a charity starts with the cause and someone that is directly affected by a cause they then go on to create an event and beyond that a foundation to support that pretty much in every case that's how a charity starts not so with movember movember started in a very traditional Australian way was on a Sunday afternoon afternoon it was my brother and a mate having a few beers and they watching the world go by had a few more beers and I had the conversation turned to 70s fashion and how everything manages to come back into style there's a few more beers so there has to be some stuff that hasn't come back then want more beer and it was whatever happened to the mustache why hasn't that made a comeback so there's a lot more beers and then the day ended with a challenge to bring the mustache back so in Australia MO is slang from mustach so we renamed the month November movember and created some pretty basic rules which still stand today and they are start the month clean shaving Rock a mustache not a beard not a goatey a mustache for the 30 days of November and then we agreed that we would come together at the end of the month have a mustache theme party and award a prize for the best and of course the worst mustache now trust me when you're growing a mustache back in 2003 and there were 30 of us back then and this is before the ironic uh hipster mustache [Laughter] movement amazing it created a lot of controversy so my boss wouldn't let me go and see clients my girlfriend at the time who's no longer my girlfriend hated it parents would Shuffle kids away from us but we came together at the end of the month and we celebrated our journey and it was a real journey and uh we had a lot of fun and in 2014 I said to the guys that was so much fun we need to legitimize this so we can get away with it year on year so we started thinking about that and we were inspired by the women around us and all they were doing for breast cancer we thought you know what there's nothing for Men's Health why is that why why can't we combine growing a mustache and do something for men's health and I started to research that topic and discovered prostate cancer is the male equivalent of breast cancer in terms of the number of men that die from it and diagnosed with it but there was nothing for this cause so we married growing a mustache with prostate cancer and then we created our tagline which is changing the face of men's health and that eloquently describes a challenge changing your appearance for the 30 days and also the outcome that we're trying to achieve getting men engaged in their health having them have a better understanding about the health risk that they face so with that model I then uh cold C the CEO of the Prostate Cancer Foundation I said to him I've got the most amazing idea that's going to transform your organization and I didn't want to share with him the idea over the phone so I convinced him to meet with me for coffee in Melbourne in 2004 and we sat down and I shared with you my vision of getting men growing mustaches across Australia raising awareness for this cause and funds for his organization and I needed a partnership to legitimately do that and I said we're going to come together at the end we're going to have a mustache themed party we're going to have DJs we're going to celebrate life and we're going to change the face of men's health and he just looked at me and laughed and he said he said Adam that's a really novel idea but we're an Ultra conservative organization we can't have anything to do with you so I paid for coffee that day and uh his parting comment as we shook hands was listen if you happen to raise any money out of this we'll gladly take it so my lesson that year was persistence and we persisted and we got 450 guys growing m SES and together we raised $54,000 and we donated every cent of that to the Prostate Cancer Foundation of Australia and that represented at the time the single biggest donation they'd ever received so from that day forward my life has become about a mustache every day this morning I wake up and go my life is about a mustache essentially I'm a mustache farmer and my season is November so in 2005 the campaign uh got more momentum was more successful in Australia and than New Zealand um and then in 2006 we came to a pivotal Point uh we we it was consuming so much of our time after hours on weekends that we thought we either need to close this down or figure a way to fund movember so that I could quit my job and go and spend more time in the organization and take it to the next level it's really interesting when you try and figure a way to fund a fundraising organization built off growing mustaches let me tell you there's not too many people interested in investing in that not even the Prostate Cancer Foundation who had raised about $1.2 million for at that stage so again we persisted and fosters Brewing came to the party and gave us our first ever uh sponsorship and that was enough for me to quit my job I salting on the side and leading into movember uh 2006 we'd run through all the money from Fosters we'd run through all the money I had and essentially we had no money left and we convinced all our suppliers creative agencies web development agencies hosting companies whatnot to delay their billing until December so we' racked up at this stage about $600,000 worth of uh debt so if November 2006 didn't happen the four Founders well we would have been broke we would have been homeless sitting on the street with mustaches but we thought you know what if that's the worst thing that happens so what we're going to have a lot of fun doing it and it taught us the importance of taking risks and really smart risks then in early 2007 a really interesting thing happened we had MOS from from Canada from the US and from the UK emailing us and calling us and saying hey there's nothing for prostate cancer bring this campaign to these countries so we thought why not let's do it so I Cole called the CEO of prostate cancer Canada and I said to him I have this most amazing concept it's going to transform your organization I don't want to tell you about it now but will you meet with me if I fly all the way to Toronto so I flew here met down on Front Street East and we sat in the boardroom I said right here's my vision of getting men growing mustaches all across Canada raising awareness and funds for your organization and he looked at me and laughed and said Adam sounds like a really novel idea but we're an ultra conservative organization I've heard this before I know what I know how it goes uh but he said we will partner with you but we're not going to invest in it you need to figure a way to bring this campaign across here and make it work so what we did was we took some of the money that we raised in Australia to bring the campaign across to this country the US and UK and we did that because we knew if this was successful we could raise infinitely more money globally than we could just in Australia and that money fuels research and that research will get us to a cure we're not about finding an Australian cure or a Canadian cure we're about finding the Cure so in 2007 uh we brought the campaign across here and it was it set the stage um for the campaign it wasn't as successful as we thought it would be we were sort of very gung-ho with our success in Australia and New Zealand at that stage so that year really taught us the importance of being patient and really understanding the local market before you become so bold as to set lofty targets but what I'm really pleased to say is in 2010 movember became a truly Global movement Canada was just pipped at the post in terms of the number one fundraising campaign in the world last year we had 450,000 mobos spread across the world and together we raise $77 million and that makes November now the biggest funer of prostate cancer research and support programs in the world and that is an amazing achievement when you think about us growing mustaches and for us we have redefined charity our ribbon is a hairy ribbon  our ambassadors are the mo Bros and the mo sisters and I think that's been fundamental to Our Success we hand across our brand and our campaign to those people we let them embrace it and interpret it in their own way so now I live in in Los Angeles because the Prostate Cancer Foundation of the US is based there and I always get asked by the media down there because it's so celebrity D driven who are your celebrity ambassadors and I say to them last year we're fortunate enough to have 450,000 celebrity ambassadors what what do you mean it's like every single person every single moo and mo sister that participates in movember is our celebrity Ambassador and that is so so important and fundamental to Our Success now what I want to share with you is one of my most touching uh movember moments and it happened here in Toronto last year at the end of the uh campaign uh I was out with a team it was the end of movember we'd had a great campaign and to Hon us we'd had our Fair sh of beer that night but I said you know what I think we've got one more bar left in us so we piled into a taxi and this is our taxi driver and I was sitting in the back seat and he turned around and said where you going I said Hy on that is an amazing mustache and he said I'm doing it for movember and I said so am I why and I said uh tell me your movember story and he goes listen I know it's about Men's Health I know it's about prostate cancer but this is for breast cancer I said okay that's interesting he goes last year my mom passed away from breast cancer in Sri Lanka because we couldn't afford proper treatment for her and he said this mustache is my tribute to my mom and we sort of all choked up in the back of the taxi and I didn't tell him who I was cuz I didn't think it was appropriate and I just shook his hand I said thank you so much your mom would be so proud and from that moment I realized that movember is so much more than a mustache having a joke it's about each person coming to this platform embracing it in their own way and being significant in their own life for us now at movember we really focus on three program areas and having a true impact awareness and education Survivor support programs and research now we always Focus naturally on how much we raise because it's a very tangible outcome but for me awareness and education is more important than the funds we raise because I know that is changing and saving lives today it's probably best exampled by uh a young guy that I met at South by Southwest in Austin Texas at the start of the year he came up to me and said thank you for starting movember I said thank you for doing movember I looked at him I was like I'm pretty sure you can't grow a mustache and I said what's your movember story and he said I grew the worst mustache ever but I went home for Thanksgiving dinner and pretty quickly the conversation around the table turned to what the hell was going on and weal I I I talked to them about movember and then after that my dad came up to me and at the age of 26 for the first time ever I had a conversation with my dad one-on-one about Men's Health I had a conversation with my dad about prostate cancer learned that my grandfather had prostate cancer and I was able to share with my dad that he was twice as likely to get that disease and he didn't know that and he hadn't been getting screened for it so now that guy is getting screened for prostate cancer so those conversations getting men engaged in this at whatever age is so critically important and in my view so much more important than the funds we raise now to the funds we raise and research and how we're redefining research we fund prostate cancer foundations now in 13 countries we literally fund hundreds if not thousands of Institutions and researchers around the world and when we looked at this more recently we realized there's a real lack of collaboration going on even within institutions little alone nationally little alone globally and this is not unique to prostate cancer this is this is cancer research the world over and so we said right we redefine charity we need to redefine the way these guys operate how do we do that so what we did was we created our Global action plan we're taking 10% of what's raised in each country now and putting it into a global fund we've got the best prostate cancer scientific Minds in the world that look after that fund and they come together each year and identify the number one priority and that last year was getting a better screening test so they identified that as a priority and then they've gone and recruited now through 300 researchers from around the world that are studying that topic essentially the same topic so now we're funding them to the tune of about 5 or six million dollars to collaborate and bringing them together and that's a unique thing in the cancer world and we know through that collaboration it will accelerate outcomes and that's how we're redefining the research world so what I know about my member journey is that with a really creative idea with passion with persistence and a lot of patients for mates for mustaches can inspire a room full of people and that room full of people can go on and inspire a city and that city is Melbourne my home and that City can go on and inspire a state and that state can go on and inspire a nation and beyond that you can create a global movement that is changing the face of men's health my name is Adam gon and that's my story thank  you"
Can you solve the famously difficult green-eyed logic puzzle? - Alex Gendler,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98TQv5IAtY8,"Imagine an island where 100 people, all perfect logicians, are imprisoned by a mad dictator. There's no escape, except for one strange rule. Any prisoner can approach the guards at night and ask to leave. If they have green eyes,  they'll be released. If not, they'll be tossed  into the volcano. As it happens,  all 100 prisoners have green eyes, but they've lived there since birth, and the dictator has ensured they can't learn their own eye color. There are no reflective surfaces, all water is in opaque containers, and most importantly, they're not allowed  to communicate among themselves. Though they do see each other during each morning's head count. Nevertheless, they all know no one would ever risk trying to leave without absolute certainty of success. After much pressure  from human rights groups, the dictator reluctantly agrees to let you visit the island and speak to the prisoners under the following conditions: you may only make one statement, and you cannot tell them  any new information. What can you say  to help free the prisoners without incurring the dictator's wrath? After thinking long and hard, you tell the crowd,  ""At least one of you has green eyes."" The dictator is suspicious but reassures himself that your statement couldn't have changed anything. You leave, and life on the island seems to go on as before. But on the hundredth morning  after your visit, all the prisoners are gone, each having asked to leave the previous night. So how did you outsmart the dictator? It might help to realize that the amount of prisoners is arbitrary. Let's simplify things by imagining just two, Adria and Bill. Each sees one person with green eyes, and for all they know,  that could be the only one. For the first night, each stays put. But when they see each other  still there in the morning, they gain new information. Adria realizes that if Bill had seen a non-green-eyed person next to him, he would have left the first night after concluding the statement  could only refer to himself. Bill simultaneously realizes  the same thing about Adria. The fact that the other person waited tells each prisoner his or her own eyes must be green. And on the second morning,  they're both gone. Now imagine a third prisoner. Adria, Bill and Carl each see  two green-eyed people, but aren't sure if each of the others is also seeing two green-eyed people, or just one. They wait out the first night as before, but the next morning,  they still can't be sure. Carl thinks, ""If I have non-green eyes, Adria and Bill were just  watching each other, and will now both leave  on the second night."" But when he sees both  of them the third morning, he realizes they must  have been watching him, too. Adria and Bill have each  been going through the same process, and they all leave on the third night. Using this sort of inductive reasoning, we can see that the pattern will repeat no matter how many prisoners you add. The key is the concept  of common knowledge, coined by philosopher David Lewis. The new information was not contained in your statement itself, but in telling it to everyone  simultaneously. Now, besides knowing at least one of them has green eyes, each prisoner also knows  that everyone else is keeping track of all the green-eyed people they can see, and that each of them  also knows this, and so on. What any given prisoner doesn't know is whether they themselves are one of the green-eyed people the others are keeping track of until as many nights have passed as the number of prisoners on the island. Of course, you could have spared the prisoners 98 days on the island by telling them at least 99 of you have green eyes, but when mad dictators are involved, you're best off with a good headstart."
